# Applications_of_Network_Theory_in_Finance

Financial networks based on stock prices can be constructed by using threshold correlation chosen
from the correlation matrix. The importance of this approach is to select the relevant correlations
from the correlation matrix. In order to study this, we collect N stock prices where N is a
positive integer and with each stock price having n variables. We choose one variable of the
same description for each stock price and form them to get a new data. This new data has N
variables because we start with N stock prices. For instance, in this essay, the chosen variable is
the closing price for each stock price and by using the Pearson-correlation coecient we can form
the correlation matrix between the stock prices. We then form an adjacency matrix Ac by setting
an appropriate correlation threshold on the correlation matrix. The network associated to the
matrix Ac has nodes corresponding to the stock prices and the edges corresponding to the link
connecting a pair of stock prices. We analyze this network obtained by using appropriate tools
in the network theory. We nd that the nancial network depends on the choice of the threshold
value and the real-world network is more distinguished by the relationship between stock prices
than the random network. We nd that network theory helps us to gain understanding of several
problems in quantitative nance such as the patterns of links between variation in stock prices
and the evolution of trade between companies.
