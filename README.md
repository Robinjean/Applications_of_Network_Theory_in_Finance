# Applications_of_Network_Theory_in_Finance

Assume that we have a large number of stock prices. Based
on the correlation matrix associated to the stock prices, one can build a network
using a chosen threshold correlation. This network shows the links between stock
prices. From this network, we can find sub-networks, which intended to show the
links between stock prices with strong relationship. By investigating such kinds
of sub-networks, we saw that the real-world network is more distinguished by the
relationship between stock prices than the random network. We also found that
the patterns of links between variation in stock prices and the evolution of trade
between companies are more understandable using the network theory.
